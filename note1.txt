These are the notes taken for lecture two 28.08.23

In this lecture we have covered the unix system, git and other commands, and the structure of user/kernel/system interface.
Although the commands were hard and unclear, after using the man command with vim,git,and gcc, 
everything became a little clearer and with practise I will getused to using linux and navigating smoothly through the terminal.
