											Participation Notes (5/12/2023)

* In this lecture we defined the basics of connection establishment between client and host(server)

* Number of ports of a computer: 0 ... (2^16 - 1)

* The main difference between TCP (transmission control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol) is that TCP is a connection-based protocol and UDP is connectionless.
While TCP is more reliable, it transfers data more slowly. UDP is less reliable but works more quickly. This makes each protocol suited to different types of data transfers.

* We also implemented client/server codes in C using new libraries and functions
